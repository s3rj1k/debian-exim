  * 90_Cutthrough-Fix-bug-with-dot-only-line.patch: JH/38 Fix cutthrough bug
    with body lines having a single dot. The dot was incorrectly not doubled
    on cutthrough transmission, hence seen as a body-termination at the
    receiving system - resulting in truncated mails.  Commonly the sender saw
    a TCP-level error, and retransmitted the nessage via the normal
    store-and-forward channel. This could result in duplicates received - but
    deduplicating mailstores were liable to retain only the initial truncated
    version.
  * 91_Expansions-Fix-crash-in-crypteq-On-OpenBSD-a-bad-sec.patch: Fix crash
    on "exim -be '${if crypteq{xxx}{\$aaa}{yes}{no}}'". Closes: #812585

exim4 (4.84.2-1) jessie-security; urgency=high

  * New upstream security release.
    + Fix CVE-2016-1531, a local privilege escalation issue when perl_startup
      is used.
    + New options keep_environment/add_environment which are empty by default,
      i.e. any subprocesses start in a clean (empty) environment.
    + -C requires an absolute path.
    + Exim changes it's working directory to / right after startup.
  * Add macros MAIN_KEEP_ENVIRONMENT and MAIN_ADD_ENVIRONMENT to set the new
    options. Set "keep_environment =" by default to avoid a runtime warning.
    Bump exim4-config Breaks to exim4-daemon-* (<< 4.84.2).

      is unset and environment is nonempty.
    + Store the initial working directory and make it available in the new
      expansion variable $initial_cwd.

  [ Martin Pitt ]
  * debian/tests/control: Add missing python test dependency, as
    debian/tests/security calls python. Closes: #740092

  [ Andreas Metzler ]
  * 4.82 deprecated $tls_bits, $tls_certificate_verified, $tls_cipher,
    $tls_peerdn, $tls_sni and introduced tls_in_*/tls_out_* variants of these
    variables which describe the respective status of the current incoming or
    outgoing TLS connection. The rationale for this is that a single exim
    process can now use both an incoming (message reception) and outgoing
    TLS connection (callout or cutthrough delivery) concurrently. With this
    change the "old" variables were mapped to tls_in_*, i.e. they expand to
    empty values on outgoing connections. (This is not yet documented.)
    Outgoing tls-connections can therefore not be detected by nonempty
    $tls_cipher anymore. exim4-config << 4.82 used this mechanism to prevent
    sending of plaintext AUTH information on unencrypted connections. Force a
    lockstep upgrade of exim4-config by bumping the version of exim4-base's
    dependency on exim4-config to >= 4.82.

    + New expansion conditions, "inlist", "inlisti".
    + Exim no longer performs string expansion on the second string of
      the match_* expansion conditions: "match_address", "match_domain",
      "match_ip" & "match_local_part". Named lists can still be used.  The
      previous behavior made it too easy to create (remotely) vulnerable
      configurations. A more detailed rationale and explanation can be found
      on 
      https://lists.exim.org/lurker/message/20111003.122326.fbcf32b7.en.html
    + doc/pcrepattern.txt is not shipped anymore as part of the exim tarball
      (and therefore the Debian package suite.)
  * Make use of /usr/share/dpkg/buildflags.mk if available.
  * Change build system to build each binary variant in a separate copy of
    the source tree instead of re-using the copy and moving away the results
    after build. The old approach stopped working since upstream added a
    dependency on make all to make install. - As we were changing parts of
    tree (Local/Makefile) after the build this caused an (incorrect) rebuild
    on make install.

    3_remove_ALT_CONFIG_ROOT_ONLY exim will not re-gain root privileges
    (usually necessary for local delivery) if the -C option was used. This
    makes it impossible to start a fully functional damon with an alternate
    configuration file. /etc/exim4/trusted_configs (can) contain a list of
    filenames (one per line, full path given) to which this restriction does
    not apply.

    Thanks to Guido Hennecke. Closes: #386135
  * Rotate paniclog by size, not daily, to avoid rotating away
    messages after complaining from the daily cron job.
    Thanks to Dirk Meyer.
  * Update Slovak translation.
    Thanks to Peter Mann.
  * Add Wolof translation.
    Thanks to M Mamoune Mbacke
  * Add a paragraph explaning the gnutls-bin suggestion to ease DH
    parameter generation in case of entropy starvation.
    Thanks to Andi Barth and Florian Weimer.
  * Since a new version of sysvinit upload will move /var/run/ to a tmpfs
    directories under /var/run/ and their permissions are not persistent
    anymore but will be lost after a reboot. - Re-generate /var/run/exim4 in
    the init script to compensate for this. (am) (closes: #387699)
  * update-exim4.conf: Exit with an error if dc_use_split_config is neither
    true nor false instead of replacing the configuration with an empty one.
    (am) Closes: #386554
  * More intelligence for exim4_refresh_gnutls-params:
    * If certtool (from gnutls-bin) is unavailable but openssl is installed
      use openssl to re-generate DH params. (am)
    * Change exim4-base Suggests on gnutls-bin to gnutls-bin|openssl. (am)
    * Move invocation and background mechanism to exim4_refresh_gnutls-params.
      Script can now be called any time from the command line or any
      other script.
    * Only regenerate dh params if tls_advertise_hosts is non empty.
      According to Florian Weimer, DH params are only needed for
      incoming TLS connections.
    * Thanks, Yuri D'Elia. This addresses #387448
  * Improve entropy and gnutls-params docs.
  * cron-daily:
    * Invoke exim4_refresh_gnutls-params unconditionally.
    * Send out e-mail alert if gnutls-params is older than 14 days.
    * rename config varables to E4BCD_, source /etc/default/exim4
    * introduce a E4BCD_PANICLOG_NOISE variable containing a regexp.
      Paniclog is negatively filtered against that regexp and paniclog
      warning is only sent out if unfiltered lines remain. This is to allow
      work around http://www.exim.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=92
  * Prepare hosts_avoid_tls statement on SMTP transports
  * Macroize log_selector, remove +tls_cipher from examples (it is on
    by default) and always set tls_peerdn (we use TLS by default for
    outgoing connections). Make it easier to enable debug logging.
  * Mention in the comments of the default RCPT ACL that verification
    is likely to have false negatives in smarthost/satellite setups. This
    is the easiest way to fix #388460; the "real" fix would be very very
    complicated and thus unsuitable for the default configuration.
    Closes: #388460
  * README.Debian:
    * Re-Work "misc" section to contain subsection. Fix minor
      formatting issues.
    * Add a section about SELinux to the misc subsection saying that
      we currently do not have an SELinux policy but would appreciate
      people helping here. This is already bug #387327 and #390179.

      - use awk instead of sed in exim4-config.postinst (Thanks, Barry Kitson).
      - use printf '%s\n' "$foo" instead of echo "$foo". (echo in dash would
        swallow the second backslash)

        see #306134.
      - (Closes: #305957) (am)
    - apply upstream patch from
      http://www.exim.org/mail-archives/exim-users/Week-of-Mon-20050425/msg00035.html
      in some circumstances, exim writes parts of /etc/passwd and/or

    - apply upstream patch from

exim4 (4.43-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Now that 4.44 is released upload 4.43 to unstable. ;-) Merge experimental
    and unstable changelog.
  * More lintian overrides. ("X" in eximon4's description has to be capital,
    and we take care to only use settitle if it is available.
  * make nullmailer setup and the way we use mailname a lot more sensible,
    attacking #244095 and #280207:
    - mailname is not implicitely made a local domain, instead it is listed
      explicitly in dc_other_hostnames, where users can easily remove it
      from. (This is basically what postfix does, too.) When upgrading
      existing installations mailname is automatically added _once_ to
      dc_other_hostnames, on fresh installations mailname is the default
      value of dc_other_hostnames. We store the fact that we have added
      mailname to dc_other_hostnames in $dc_mailname_in_oh in
      update-exim4.conf.conf.
    - Make exim work correctly if dc_readhost ("visible, rewritten domain name
      for local users") ends up as part of local_domain, which happens if
      the same value is chosen for mailname and dc_readhost. This
      implemented by new router, hub_user_smarthost. Previously users were
      required to use something different (my.invalid.domain) for mailname.
    - Special thanks to Christian Perrier for taking care of the
      template translation updates.
  * We did not substitute the current value into the debconf templates with
    db_subst but showed the old ones from the previous debconf run.
  * /etc/exim4/email-addresses is ignored now, please use /etc/email-addresses!
  * Bosnian (bs.po) translation is complete (Thanks Adis Nezirovic).
  * Includes de.po change suggested in #286525.
  * One-line fix for incorrect fi.po translation by Kalle Olavi Niemitalo.

  * Urgency high because upgrades from woody were broken.
  * Exim4 triggers a bug in woody's debconf. - With dialog frontend, invoked
    by dpkg-preconfigure you are stuck in a loop, always being asked the same
    two questions (split config, and basic configtype) again and again until
    you give up and choose split_config=yes although being discouraged from
    doing so. I am working around this by making the config-script abort if
    debconf is old and we are running in preconfigure mode. (Thanks to Dan

  * Add comment in configuration file documenting that effective retry times
    depend on _both_ retry-rules and frequency of queue running. Keep
    default QUEUEINTERVAL at 30m because running the queue can be quite
    expensive and because therespective RFCs suggest 30m as minimal waiting
    time. (Closes: #242426)
  * Installation over serial console/minicom only has a screen size of 80
    characters x 24 lines available. Sigh. Shorten config-type question by
    cutting down the introduction. (Closes: #244464). Shorten relay-net
    question by replacing a unnecessarily complicated formulation with a
    clearer one which closes: #226809.
  * Debconf supports masquerading as a different host with rewriting not only
    for "satellite" but also for "smarthost" system. (Closes: #229911).
    - Introduces another but hopefully last pre-sarge template change.
      (This includes final versions of the templates without the dead
      references to "satellite" which closes: #229902.)
    - Rewrite /this/ stuff at smtp transport time. /etc/email-addresses
      rewriting still uses normal rewriting because it always has and because
      it is easier to setup.
    - This still does not address one basic issue, the misuse of /etc/mailname
      for qualifying recipeints because this needs clarification in policy
      _and_ changing MUAs to not do this. Therefore I declare this post-sarge.
    - Thanks to Chris Cheney for the kick, and to Adam Conrad and Wouter
      Verhelst for their help.
  * Add two fixes from upstream:
    - Change 4.31/55 was buggy and broke sender address rewriting and caching.
    - Change 4.24/6 broke the SIGALRM handler with deliver_drop_privilege.
  * README.TLS.gz and the actual configuration disagreed (Thanks, Richard
    Lamont).
  * Fix thinko in update-exim4defaults that made --queuetime a no-op.

    - includes the fix for the caching bug and uses MAIL FROM <> as default
      value for recipient callouts again.
    - new exiscan adds a local "Received:" header to the copy passed to
      spamassassin tofix evaluation of DNS lists, compensating for
      ChangeLog 4.31/66. (Closes: #242730)
  * Remove obsolete reference to auth_over_tls_hosts from documentation.
    (Thanks Jonas Meurer)
  * Enable SMTP authentication (hosts_try_auth) per default when sending
    mail to smarthost. No need to edit the configuration-file anymore if you
    just need to forward all mail to a smarthost with AUTH. (Closes: #203307)
  * Hungarian translation of debconf templates by VEROK Istvan.
    (Closes: #242931)
  * remove "exim 3 will stay default MTA for Debian sarge" from
    README.Debian as TPTB have decided otherwise. (Closes: #243687).
  * Rewrite "Sender:"-header for "satellite" configuration profile, too.
    (Closes: #228978)
  * Use the normal user account set-up during installation as default
    destination for delivery of mail for root. (Joey Hess)
  * Shorten exim4/dc_postmaster template to fit on console. (Joey Hess)
    (Closes: #242303)
  * In template suggest using real-foo to force local delivery.
    (Closes: #229909)
  * Template changes reviewed by debian-l10n-english. There might still be
    more changes, translators should probably wait a little bit longer before
    updating the translation.
  * On fresh installations smarthost profile only listens on loopback per
    default. - There are valid uses of "smarthost" that require listening on
    public interfaces but the most common one (dialup) does not.
  * Ship README.Debian.UUCP by Andreas Barth in /usr/share/doc/exim4-base. -
    This resolves our part of #201153.

exim4 (4.31-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version 4.31 (exiscan 4.31-16)
    - Supports CRL (Certificate Revocation List) (Closes: #229063)
    - exim_dbmbuild does not crash on _very_ long RHS values.
      (Closes: #231597)
    - route_list does not use a fixed lenght buffer anymore. (Closes: #231979)
    - An empty tls_verify_certificates file is correctly interpreted as empty
      list instead of breaking TLS. (Closes: #236478)
  * Korean translation of debconf templates by Changwoo Ryu (Closes: #241499)
  * Minor changes to rcpt_acl:
    * add missing message = qualifiers. (Closes: #240862)
    * resync against upstream default, incorporating change 4.23/30, allowing
      "/" and "|" in nonlocal addresses.

exim4 (4.30-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * remove dc_never_users from /etc/exim4/u-ex.conf.conf and the corresponding
    pattern DEBCONFnever_usersDEBCONF from the template. The code is
    superfluous since 4.24 introduced FIXED_NEVER_USERS and was broken, user
    changes were not preserved. (am)
  * Link against libmysqlclient10 instead of libmysqlclient12 to circumvent
    symbol-clashes when using PAM with libpam-mysql. (Closes: #235938) (am)
  * Dump temporary build-conflict with broken po-debconf. (am)
  * Copy ugly passwd-dependency from -base to -config. (am)
  * Do not throw away adduser's errormessages. Together with the added
    dependency noted above this (Closes: #237657). (am)
  * Installed copy of default configuration-file (example.conf) refered to the
    temporary install-directory. Ugly hotfix. (Closes: #236483)
  * Italian translation of debconf templates by Danilo Piazzalunga.
    (Closes: #237500)
  * Rewrite generation of /etc/aliases because it was broken when running
    under debbian-installer/debootstrap, which installs the packages with
    DEBIAN_FRONTEND=nointeractive and reconfigures them later (report by
    Florian Effenberger). (am)
    Instead of generating it _once_ and touching it never again ask for and
    add alias for root if it is missing. Debconf template
    exim4/dc_noalias_regenerate is not used any more. (Closes: #237524)
  * Norwegian Bokmål translation of debconf templates by Steinar H. Gunderson.
    (Closes: #237680)
  * Dump local_scan perl-plugin. Upstream development has stopped. (am)
  * Maintainer scripts now run with -x if environment variable EX4DEBUG
    is set (mh).

    (Closes: #229910)
  * Spanish translation of debconf templates by Javi Castelo. (Closes: #232207)
  * To increase robustness set explicit "domains = +local_domains" on all the
    routers that are supposed to be handling _only_ local mail (i.e. anything
    after dnslookup or smarthost) instead of relying on the no_more.

    If the router handling remote addresses was modified by adding a
    precondition the address would have wrongly been handled by the later
    routers if the precondition failed, breaking at least "verify = sender".
    (Closes: #230403) (am)
  * In the data ACL add a Message-ID header to mails injected with SMTP from
    +relay_from_hosts. (Exim stopped doing this by default in 4.30.) (mh)
  * binary-all metapackage exim4 does not depend anymore on exim4-base with
    exactly the same version. There is no necessity for dependencies that
    strict and it broke both binary NMUs and installability on lagging
    architectures. (Closes: #231678) (am)
  * Give way to the "I use sid but keep it outdated by not running apt-get
    upgrade ever."-fraction. exim4-base now depends on working versions of
    passwd i.e. the version in woody or the one that has been in sid
    for more than 6 months. (Closes: #230423,#230836,#231111) (am)
  * in source-package symlink identical maintainerscripts. (am/mh)
  * Ship README.Debian.xinetd, explaning why we do not use (x)inetd and how to
    use xinetd properly if you insist. (Closes: #226627)
  * Update Build-Depencies to fit the XFree86 4.3 packages.
  * Make new lintian happy by quoting section and needs in eximon's
    menu-file.

    Konstantinos Margaritis (Greek), Christian Perrier (French),
    Kenshi Muto (Japanese), Bart Cornelis (Dutch), André Luís Lopes
    (Brazilian Portuguese) and Ilgiz Kalmetev (Russian) (am)
  * After merging translations split the configtype-template, using the
    __Choices trick. I don't think I made any errors because podebconf's
    output has not changed. (am)
  * Don't use /etc/mailname (DEBCONFvisiblenameDEBCONF) as primary_hostname
    for minimaldns option. (Closes: #225477)
  * (Re)introduce /etc/exim4/exim4.conf.template as alternative to the
    multiple small files in /etc/exim4/conf.d/ and make it the default choice
    for fresh installations. This trades in a loss of comfort (you will again
    need to merge in each small change manually) for increased stability.
    (Closes: #224828) (am)
  * Disable piping to programs in /etc/aliases per default, because they would
    run as Debian-exim:Debian-exim per default. Add README.system_aliases
    suggesting dedicated router/transport pairs (am/mh) (Closes: #228062)
  * modify create-custom-package and adapt debian/rules to allow
    building multiple named custom packages in a single build. (mh)
  * "dpkg-reconfigure exim4-config" actually tells exim4 to read the updated
    configuration. (am)

    - most interesting new feature: $acl_xx are now saved with the

    - Cannot run deliveries as root anymore. If you don't redirect mail for
      root via /etc/aliases or other means to a nonpriviledged account the
      mail will be delivered to /var/mail/mail with permissions 0600 and owner
      mail:mail. Change to local_user router to keep it from trying to route

  * Ship README.SIEVE (Thanks to Ross Boylan)
  * Sync some debconf templates against the respective ones in postfix

  * exim4-config conflicts with bash (<< 2.05), because it cannot handle

    from potato to sarge because debconf-config might happen before the

exim4 (4.20-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * update-exim4.conf works without daemon-package (Closes:#195329)
  * Add dnslookup_relay_to_domains router for "internet" config to
    allow relaying for domains with an MX pointing to an rfc1918
    address. (Closes: #198410) (MH)
  * update-exim4.conf would hang if one of the subdirectories in conf.d
    was empty. (Report and fix by Marc Merlin)
  * Build-Depend on libgnutls7
  * Preserve comments in update-exim4.conf.conf by first adding missing
    items and replacing the values with sed instead of regenerating file
    from scratch (Closes: #184099)
  * Set return_path_add, delivery_date_add and envelope_to_add for
    maildir-transport (Closes: #196178)
  * Use email-addresses file in /etc/ instead of in /etc/exim4 as exim3 does,
    exim4-config now needs to conflict with exim,exim-tls. We still include
    code for evaluating the old file if it exist, but suggest moving the
    contents to the new file in NEWS.Debian. postinst will remove old orphaned
    file if it is unmodified. (Closes: #197136)
  * Set return_fail_output instead of return_output on address_pipe transport.
    (Closes: #201280)
  * Stop generating rewriting rules dynamically, exim4 accepts any
    "address-list" item as source-pattern for rewriting. (Changelog entry
    obfuscated on purpose, read exim4debian for painful details.). Remove old
    dynamically generated files in postinst if they were managed by upex4conf.
  * daemon-light supports TLS (Closes: #193596)

  * Fix some inconsistencies in the postsinst related to the above that
